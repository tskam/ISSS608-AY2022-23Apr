    "text": "Course Assessment\nThe assessment for this course consists of four major components, namely:\n\nIn-class Hands-on exercise and class participation,\nDataViz Makeover\nTake-home exercises,\nVisual Analytics Project.\n\nThere will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\n\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on exercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are guided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides will be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson, students are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for reviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection. Students will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise, 7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if absent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 1.5-2 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students with first hand experiences on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page."

    "text": "Words of Encouragement\nFor the next 10 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily."

At a first glance, it seems making a lot of sense. But, when we try to take a closer look at the text and graph, you will notice that there are at least two major issues, one is related to truthfulness of the data visualisation and the second one is related to its clarity aspect. For example, the x-axis is showing quarterly time interval. But, the second sentence talks about “For the first half this year, Nodx fell 4.5 per cent compared with the same period last year.” which is not inline with what was shown on the x-axis. Furthermore, the values on the y-axis are in per cent. Hence the correct term should be percentage point instead of per cent because we are comparing the differences between two percentages.\nThis is what motivate me to design this course. This course is not about using Tableau or R to create beautiful data visualisation only. More importantly, it aims to embark you the skills of getting smarter when reading data visualisation. From today onwards, I would like to encourage you to take a good look at every data visualisation you come across and carefully evaluate them not only from their aestheticness only but also their clarity."

I call this Junk Chart. As we know, junk foods are very tempting but not healthy. Similar, Junk Charts tends to be very appealing but they are not useful to gain data understanding. For example, it is not possible for us to do an effective comparison between global sales revenue and reinvestment in R&D because of the inappropriate use of 3d bar chart.\nThe important take away from this slide is to avoid creating eye candy data visualisation. We should create data visualisation that are functional instead."

These understanding can be used to support effective model building.\nData visualisation also should be used to reveal modelling results.

The line graph on the slide is a good example. This is a trade balance line graph prepared by William Playfair in 1786. You probably have identify this chart as a common line graph. The horizontal axis is years, the vertical axis measures the volume of imports and export. When you take a good look at the graph, you will be very impressed by conscious effort given by the author to shade the space between the import and export lines. When the trade balance was against England, the area was shared in red and when the trade balance was in favour of England, the area was shaded in brown. With the advancement of graph drawing tools, sadly to say, we hardly see this carefully crafted line graph been used."

Many of us know Florence as The Mother of Nursing, but she was also a statistician, and reformer. If we look at the rose diagram, we can see that the area of each coloured wedge, measured from the centre, is in proportion to the statistic it represents. The blue outer wedges represent the deaths from contagious diseases, such as cholera and typhus. The central red wedges show the deaths from wounds. The black wedges in between represent deaths from all other causes. If this rate had continued, and troops had not been replaced frequently, then disease alone would have killed the entire British Army in the Crimea. Nightingale’s graph not only dramatised the extent of the needless deaths among the soldiers during the Crimean War, but it was used as a tool to persuade Victorial government and medical profession that deaths were preventable if sanitation reforms were implemented in military and civilian hospitals."

At the first glance, it resemble the flow map but the map actually reveal more information than a common flow map. The illustration depicts Napoleon’s army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard’s interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers. This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey (9 November 1853 – 3 October 1926) used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow. Interestingly, If you take a closer look at the lower center of the graph, you will notice that the term Tableau Graphique was used.\nThe important learning lesson from these four historical data visualisation is that in order to design a functional and yet enlightening data visualisation, we need to master the science and arts of data visualisation design instead of using default graphing functions of modern data visualisation toolkit. Just like writing, by knowing how to use MS Word, you will not be able to become a great editor."

It may be a mixture of these—for example, even seemingly simple exploratory plots should serve some (perhaps implicit) decision (e.g., on how to explore further). Every graph, and, more generally, every communication, must be tailored to its specific purpose."

    "text": "The Devil is in the Data\n\n\nClean and tidy data are needed to build truthful data visualisation. But beside clean and tidy data, there are at least two considerations related to data require our attention.\n\n\n\nNumbers Worth Knowing\nNot all numerical data are continuous!\n\n\nFirst, it is important to note that not all numerical data are continuous. There are two types of numerical data. They are discrete and continuous. Discrete data can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count discrete values, and the results are in frequency count or in per cent . For example, display size should be classified as discrete (i.e. nominal or ordinal scales) instead of continuous., a mean of 15.81 in monitor is no meaning. Continuous data can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous variables have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\n\n\n\n\nVisualising the Right Data\n\nThere are more than one way to present the data.\n\n\n\nSecondly, there are more than one way to present the data. It is not unusual by presenting derived data reveal more aha surprises than the raw data.\n\n\n\n\nVisualising the Right Data\n\nDerived values reveal more interesting patterns than absolute values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data visualisation on the left is a dual y-axis bar graph. The y-axis on the left shows revenue and the y-axis on right shows customers. From the graph, you can see how both the monthly revenue and number of customers are growing for this company.\nThe data visualisation on the right shows the differences between the month-to-month % change of revenue and customers. By showing the data in percent change, the data visualisation allows us to discover that the month-to-month customers and revenue growth rate are reducing in the financial year.\n\n\n\n\nVisualising the Right Data\n\nDerived values reveal more interesting patterns than absolute values.\n\n\n\nBy deriving revenue per customer and plot them as a line graph, the data visualisation allows us to tell a more compelling data story. In the figure, we can see that revenue per customer has decreased significantly during the year, even though the monthly revenue has risen steadily. The important take away from this case study is that select the right data to prepare the data visualisation and be mindful that the raw data might not always be the right choice."

The mosaic plot in panel (c) only relies on areas; again, it is hard to tell the order of magnitude. It is better to use lengths with a common baseline or positions on a common scale, such as in a bar chart or dot plot (see Cleveland-McGill effectiveness ranking in Law 3). The bar chart in panel (d), however, introduces a fake dimension, which is unnecessary and makes it hard to decode the numerical values from the height of the bars. Panels (e) and (f) are appropriately simple and show the data clearly. They also order the data by magnitude to aid comparison even further.

The blog link is available on the last slide.\n\n\n\nChartJunk I\n\nAvoid using unnecessary colour shading for the bar.\n\n\nIn this data visualisation, it is very obvious that the different intensity colours shading used on the bars and background are not map to any meaningful variables. These are junk that should be avoid in our graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChartJunk II\n\nAvoid colourful or wallpaper background.\n\n\nIn this data visualisation, the background patterns make it impossible for us to read the words in the legend. Likewise the watermarks used as the background of the graph is redudant. Again, these are junk that we should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\nChartJunk III\n\nAvoid using 3D effects in graphics.\n\n\nIt is very common for us to see 3D bar chart was used to present frequency distribution of a categorical variable like the data visualisation on the left of the slide. In fact, the fancy 3D bar chart is less effective to read as compared to the simple bar chart on the right of the slide. The key take away is avoid using 3D object to display univariate data.\n\n\n\n\n\nChartJunk IV\n\nAvoid using misleading graphical representation.\n\n\nIn this data visualisation, there is no way for us to know what is the sales volume represented by one potato because their ratio varies from one year to another.\n\n\n\n\n\nChartJunk V\n\nAvoid using artistic design which is difficult to visualise.\n\n\nAlthough the visualisation is very appealing visually. However, it is not functional because the curve 3D bar chart make it very difficult to do a proper comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nChartJunk VI\n\nDesigning graph to enlighten people – not to entertain them.\n\n\nThis is another good example of JunkChart. In this data visualisation, the author distorts the sequence of the age-cohort intentionally in order to show the ladder-like view. But this design easily lead to misinterpretation by the graph users."

    "text": "Visualising Uncertainty\n\nWhy it is important?\n\n\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of data visualization is the visualization of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chart 61, LABOUR FORCE IN SINGAPORE 2019, pg. 52.\n\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of visual analytics is the visualisation of uncertainty. When we see data point drawn in a specific location, we tend to interpret it as a precise representation of the true value. It is difficult to conceive that a data point could actually lie somewhere it hasn’t been drawn. Yet this scenario is ubiquitous in data visualisation. Nearly every dataset we work with has some uncertainty, and whether and how we choose to represent this uncertainty can make a major difference in how accurately our audience perceives the meaning of the data.\nTwo commonly used approaches to indicate uncertainty are error bars and confidence bands. In this section, we will examine the basic concepts and design pricinples of these methods.\n\n\n\n\nWhy one shouldn’t use a bar graph, even if the data are normally distributed?\n\n\n\nIt is not appropriate to displace average values on bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure on the right is an EDA plot that I use to see in the Assignment 1 reports of ISSS602 Data Analytics Lab. Bar chart should be used to show count or frequency count and should not be used to reveal summary statistics such as mean. This is because the bar failed to show the range of observed values.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Error bar failed?\n\n\n\nEach error bar is constructed using a 95% confidence interval of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an error bar, the bar height represents the mean. Error bars represent 1 standard error. The y-axis starts at zero and ends just above the highest error bar.\nGiven that the y-axis typically starts at zero, bars often include irrelevance values as shown in the figure. zone of irrelevance.\n\n\n\n\nError bar on a dot plot\n\n\n\nEach error bar is constructed using a 95% confidence interval of the percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe error plot on dot plot is more truthful and informative alternatives to the error bar graph in previous slide. The plot reveals the value range of each race clearly. By applying inking principle in the design, the error plot and the mean value of each race is shown clearly.\n\n\n\n\nGraphical methods for visualising uncertainty\n\n\nReference: Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates\n\n\nThis figure shows different different alternative design of error plots: + graded error plots with caps; + graded error plots without caps; + single-interval error plots with caps; + single-interval error plots without caps; + confidence strips; and + confidence distributions.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to all these choices. You are encouraged to explore them one by one and select the best data visualisation that meet you storytelling need.\n\n\n\n\nBack to Statistics 101\n\nPopulation and samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen drawing many samples from a population, it is possible to obtain a few with means that greatly differ from the population.\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders]\n\n\nin order to prepare an error plot manually, it is good for us the revise some of the basic statistical concepts.\n\n\n\n\nA reminder of the standard normal distribution\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nIf the distribution of heights in the population is roughly normal (and, again, we don’t know this), your answer can be inspired by a chart in this slide, which displays the percentage of scores that lie in between a certain number of standard deviations from the mean. We see that 68.2 percent of score lie between -1 and 1 standard deviations from the mean, and just 0.1 percent of scores are above three standard deviation.\n\nIn a standard normal distribution, 95 percent of the scores lie between z-score -1.96 and 1.96 (that is, between -1.96 and 1.96 standard deviations from the mean).\nAlso in a standard normal distribution, 99 percent of the scores lie between z-scores -2.58 and 2.58 (they are between -2.58 and 2.58 standard deviations from the mean)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard error\n\n\nThe formulas of standard deviation and standard error\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nImagine that instead of drawing just a few samples from our population, we are able to get dozens of random samples of 40 purples each and that we calculate the mean of each of them.\nNext, imagine that we discard all scores from all samples, and that we just keep their means. Then, we draw a histogram of just these means. This imaginary histogram is called a distribution of sample means. As any other distribution, it will have a mean of its own (a mean of sample means) and a standard deviation. This standard deviation of many imaginary sample means is called the standard error of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the confidence interval of a mean\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nA confidence interval is an expression of the uncertainty around any statistic we wish to report. It is based on the standard error, and it’s usually communicated this way:\n“With a 95 percent level of confidence, we estimate that the average height of 12-year-old purples is 5.3feet +/-(margin of error here).\nTo calculate a confidence interval first, we need to decide on a confidence level. The most common one is 95% and 98%, although you could really pick any figure you wish. What we need to remember is that the greater the confidence level we choose, the greater the margin of error becomes.\nLet us begin with the confidence interval for the mean of a sample. The average height of purples in our sample was 5.3 feet, and the standard deviation was 0.5. The 5.3 score is a point estimate. Reporting it on its own isn’t correct. We must also disclose the uncertainty that surrounds it. The formulas for the confidence interval of the mean of a large sample and to apply them are in the slide. The z in red is called the critical value.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the confidence interval of a percentage\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nThis slide shows the formulas to calculate the confidence interval of a percentage. Notice that the main different in these formula.\n\n\n\n\n2-d graphical methods for visualising uncertainty\n\n\n\nScatter plot with 95% confidence ellipse\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot with 95% confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart on the left shows the 95% confidence ellipse of a scatter plot and the chart on the right shows the 95% confidence band of a trend line (also known as best fit line).\nIt is a common mistake to think that 95% confidence ellipse contains 95% of the data. A 95% confidence ellipse for it’s mean is really an algorithm with the following property: if you were to replicate our sampling from the underlying distribution many times and each time calculate a confidence ellipse, then 95% of the ellipses so constructed would contain the underlying mean. (Note that each sample would of course yield a different ellipse.)\n\n\n\n\nConfidence band of a trend line\n\n\n\nConfidence band and fit lines\n\n\n\n\nA graded confidence band\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 95% confidence band, on the other hand, provides us with a range of different fit lines that would be compatible with the data. When student encounter a confidence band for the first time, they are often surprised that even a perfectly straight line produces a confidence band that is curved. The reason for the curvature is that the straight line fit can move in two distinct directions: it can be up and down (i.e have different intercepts), and it can rotate (i.e. having different slopes.)\nTo draw a confidence ban, we need to specify a confidence lvel, and just as we did for error plots, it can be useful to highlight different levels of confidence. This leads us to the graded confidence band, which shows several confidence levels at once."

    "section": "Variation and Its Discontents",
    "text": "Variation and Its Discontents\n\nRandom and unfair comparisons\n\n\nReference: Variation and its discontents\n\n\nCentral to quantitative data analysis is an understanding of variation. When we measure multiple occurrences of things to determine how and to what extent they differ, we’re examining variation. Some variation is random and some is caused by factors that we can attempt to identify and perhaps control. Random variation consists of differences in measures that occur routinely, without a specific cause. We should note random variation and move on, because nothing can be done about it. It is noise. It tells us nothing that requires a response.\nInstances of non-random variation are signals; they tell us something useful and provide opportunities for action. Signals that indicate poor performance—an undesirable state—can perhaps be reduced by controlling the causes. Signals that indicate an especially good state of affairs can provide useful insights and opportunities for improvement.\nDespite the significance of variation, relatively few people who work with data in most organizations understand it, especially the nature of randomness. This leads to false conclusions and poor decisions, especially when comparing measures of performance within a set of like entities (e.g., countries or companies). Most organizations spend too much time examining noise: the cacophony of random variation. Learning to distinguish signals from the noise is a fundamental skill of data analysis and performance monitoring. In this article, we’ll take a look at a special version of a scatter plot, called a funnel plot (not to be confused with a funnel chart), which is designed to filter out the noise and shine a spotlight on meaningful variation when we compare performance among entities in a group. Funnel plots address the fact that entities with relatively few occurrences of the thing being measured (a small sample), when compared to entities with many occurrences (a large sample), exhibit a greater degree of random variation, which must be taken into account when comparing them. A little later we’ll take a look at this problem and the solution that funnel plots provide in relation to healthcare data, but first let’s get more familiar with the effects of sample size on randomness.\nConsider the following display (a caterpillar plot) of actual healthcare data. Each data point represents a hospital, with 260 in total. The values are mortality rates following surgeries and the solid horizontal line represents the mean.\nThe sample sizes (number of surgeries reported by each hospital) on which this graph is based range from 7 to 3,151. For this reason it isn’t appropriate to rank the hospitals by mortality rate. The ranking suggests a relationship of relative performance that cannot be determined by the data.\nImagine that, unlike the anonymous version of the graph above, each data point is labeled with the hospital’s name. Can you hear the screams of surgeons from the hospitals with the highest mortality rates in the 4th quartile section of the chart? Can you see the puffed up egos of the surgeons who work at the hospitals with mortality rates of zero in the 1st quartile section? One of the hospitals with a zero mortality rate provided a sample of only seven surgeries.\nNote: You might realize, especially if you work with healthcare data similar to the example above, that a fair comparison of hospitals would require the data to be adjusted not just to account for varying sample sizes but also for varying levels of risk. Some surgeries are more risky than others and some patients, due to varying levels of illness, are more at risk than others. We’ll ignore this for now to keep the example simple.\n\n\n\n\nFunnel plots to the rescue\n\n\n\n\nStatistical details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis funnel plot displays one data point per hospital, each of which shows the number of surgeries and the square root transformed mortality rate. The square roots of the mortality rates are not particularly meaningful in and of themselves, but that doesn’t matter because we’re simply trying to identify the hospitals that exhibit a level of performance that is outside of the boundaries of random variation and thus, according to the language of statistical process control, were probably due to a “special cause.” The farther a value falls outside of the boundaries, the more likely it is due to a special cause rather than randomness.\nNotice in the lower left-hand corner of the same plot below that two of the hospitals with mortality rates of zero reside within the boundaries, which indicates that we cannot rely on their low rates as significant.\nIt is important to note that in making this comparison, we are assuming that the hospitals are homogeneous, all part of a single system which might not true in real world. For example, surgeries of many types are being compared without taking into account the fact that surgeries vary significantly in mortality risk. Likewise, patients of various levels of heath are being compared without taking into account that some of them went into surgery much healthier than others and were therefore at lesser mortality risk.\nIt is routine when dealing with heterogeneous entities such as different types of surgeries and patients of varying levels of health to adjust values to account for these factors. In a case such as post-surgical mortality, typically an expected number of deaths is calculated to account for varying levels of risk and then the observed (actual) number of deaths that occurred is compared to this, resulting in an observed vs. expected (O/E) ratio. For a completely fair comparison of post-surgical mortality among these hospitals, it is this O/E ratio that should appear in the funnel plot.\n\n\n\nNormality assumption\n\n\n\nBefore plotting the graph, it is important to check if the values are conformed to normal distribution assumption.\nIf the raw values are not conformed to normality assumption, they have to be transformed."

These features include: cultural: roads, buildings, urban development, railways, airports, names of places and geographic features, administrative boundaries, state and international borders, reserves hydrography: lakes, rivers, streams, swamps, coastal flats relief: mountains, valleys, slopes, depressions vegetation: wooded and cleared areas, vineyards and orchards.\nA map legend (or key) lists the features shown on that map, and their corresponding symbols. Topographic maps usually show a geographic graticule and a coordinate grid, so you can determine relative and absolute positions of mapped features.\nIt is important to note that a map is merely a two or three dimensional representation of the physical environment at a given time. Therefore, a map will never be entirely up to date. Changes to the landscape and cultural features regularly occur (such as roads, vegetation, and buildings), resulting in maps becoming dated, although the rate of obsolescence varies depending upon location.

For example, the proportional maps above use circle with different sizes to represent millions of people. There are two types of point features that are typically depicted with proportional symbols: features for which the data represents a geographic position directly (e.g., gallons of oil from individual oil wells), and features that are geographic areas to which data are aggregated and the data magnitudes are assigned to a representative point within the area (e.g., the geographic centroid of a state as in the examples above). In either case, the area of the symbol is scaled to represent the data magnitude, sometimes with a bit of exaggeration to adjust for a general tendency of human vision to underestimate differences in area. A variant on this direct data-to-symbol scaling groups values into categories first, then scales the symbol to represent the mean for the category, assigning a symbol to each place to represent the category range that the mean for the place falls within\n\n\n\nHow to size circles incorrectly and correctly?\nFigure below explains how attribute values are map on circles. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use square instead of circle.\n\n\n\n\nHow to make proportional symbol maps clearer?\nWhen designing a proportional symbol map, one of the important consideration is to avoid the circles blocking each other. One possible strategy to overcome this problem is to applying opacity (also known as transparency).\n\n\n\n\nProportional Symbol Map: Pie Chart Map\nOne important characteristic of proportional symbols is that they can easily be designed to represent more than one data value per location. Among the most common example is a pie chart map in which a circle is scaled proportionally to some total, and the size of wedges within the circle is scaled to depict a proportion of a total for two or more sub-categories.\n\n\nOne important characteristic of proportional symbols is that they can easily be designed to represent more than one data value per location. Among the most common example is a “pie chart map” in which a circle is scaled proportionally to some total, and the size of wedges within the circle is scaled to depict a proportion of a total for two or more sub-categories. The map above uses circle size to depict total sales in each city, and the pie slices then depict proportion of the three shipping modes, namely: delivery truck, express air and regular air.\n\n\n\n\nProportional Symbol Map: Bar Chart Map\nProportional side-by-side bar map places side-by-side bar chart on a map based on the location of the observations.\n\n\n\n\nProportional Symbol Map - Junk Map\nWhen preparing a proportional symbol map, it is important to ensure that the geographical level used is the same.\n\n\nSource: COVID-19 Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nAltertive of Proportional Symbol Map: Bricks Map\nBricks Map aims to provide better ways to encode quantitative information graphically—ways that can be easily, efficiently, and accurately decoded.\n\n\nSource: Building insight with bricks.\n\n\n\n\nBricks Map versus Proportional Symbol Map\nBy plotting a proportional symbol map and a bricks map side-by-side as shown below, it is clear that bubbles of graduated sizes proportional to the value ranges that they represent can be difficult to distinguish than the bricks."

L. et. al. 2009\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: Measures of Power and Influence\n\n\n\nA collection of statistical measures to report:\n\nthe connectivity of a node within a network,\nthe complexity of a network,\nthe clusters or sub-groups within a network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: Degree\n\n\n\nDegree, the number of direct connections a node has.\nDegree is often interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: In-degree & Out-degree\n\n\n\nIf the network is directed (meaning that ties have direction), then we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree.\nIndegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node, and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others.\nFor positive relations such as friendship or advice, we normally interpret indegree as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: Betweenness centrality\n\n\n\nBetweenness is a centrality measure of a vertex within a graph (there is also edge betweenness, which is not discussed here).\nVertices that occur on many shortest paths between other vertices have higher betweenness than those that do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: Closeness Centrality\n\n\n\nIn graph theory closeness is a centrality measure of a vertex within a graph. Vertices that are ‘shallow’ to other vertices (that is, those that tend to have short geodesic distances to other vertices with in the graph) have higher closeness.\nCloseness is preferred in network analysis to mean shortest-path length, as it gives higher values to more central vertices, and so is usually positively associated with other measures such as degree.\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: Eigenvector Centrality\n\n\n\nA measure of the importance of a node in a network.\nIt assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Metrics: Clustering Coefficient\n\n\n\nA measure on how connected a vertex’s neighbours are to one another. More specifically, it is the number of edges connecting a vertex’s neighbours divided by the total number of possible edges between the vertex’s neighbour."

At a first glance, it seems making a lot of sense. But, when we try to take a closer look at the text and graph, you will notice that there are at least two major issues, one is related to truthfulness of the data visualisation and the second one is related to its clarity aspect. For example, the x-axis is showing quarterly time interval. But, the second sentence talks about “For the first half this year, Nodx fell 4.5 per cent compared with the same period last year.” which is not inline with what was shown on the x-axis. Furthermore, the values on the y-axis are in per cent. Hence the correct term should be percentage point instead of per cent because we are comparing the differences between two percentages.\nThis is what motivate me to design this course. This course is not about using Tableau or R to create beautiful data visualisation only. More importantly, it aims to embark you the skills of getting smarter when reading data visualisation. From today onwards, I would like to encourage you to take a good look at every data visualisation you come across and carefully evaluate them not only from their aestheticness only but also their clarity."

For example, it is not possible for us to do an effective comparison between global sales revenue and reinvestment in R&D because of the inappropriate use of 3d bar chart.\nThe important take away from this slide is to avoid creating eye candy data visualisation.

Further more by stitching the line graph top down and next jump to the right fail for support effective comparison.\nThe data visualisation on the right is a makeover version. It was created using the trellis method of JMP Pro. In this case, all line graphs maintain the same value range. As a result, the data visualisation reveals the differences between the five models clearly.\nAlso, by arranging the model results from left to right according to their calibration, allows us to compare the performance of each model effectively."

These understanding can be used to support effective model building.\nData visualisation also should be used to reveal modelling results.

The line graph on the slide is a good example. This is a trade balance line graph prepared by William Playfair in 1786. You probably have identify this chart as a common line graph. The horizontal axis is years, the vertical axis measures the volume of imports and export. When you take a good look at the graph, you will be very impressed by conscious effort given by the author to shade the space between the import and export lines. When the trade balance was against England, the area was shared in red and when the trade balance was in favour of England, the area was shaded in brown. With the advancement of graph drawing tools, sadly to say, we hardly see this carefully crafted line graph been used."

Many of us know Florence as The Mother of Nursing, but she was also a statistician, and reformer. If we look at the rose diagram, we can see that the area of each coloured wedge, measured from the centre, is in proportion to the statistic it represents. The blue outer wedges represent the deaths from contagious diseases, such as cholera and typhus. The central red wedges show the deaths from wounds. The black wedges in between represent deaths from all other causes. If this rate had continued, and troops had not been replaced frequently, then disease alone would have killed the entire British Army in the Crimea. Nightingale’s graph not only dramatised the extent of the needless deaths among the soldiers during the Crimean War, but it was used as a tool to persuade Victorial government and medical profession that deaths were preventable if sanitation reforms were implemented in military and civilian hospitals."

At the first glance, it resemble the flow map but the map actually reveal more information than a common flow map. The illustration depicts Napoleon’s army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard’s interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers. This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey (9 November 1853 – 3 October 1926) used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow. Interestingly, If you take a closer look at the lower center of the graph, you will notice that the term Tableau Graphique was used.\nThe important learning lesson from these four historical data visualisation is that in order to design a functional and yet enlightening data visualisation, we need to master the science and arts of data visualisation design instead of using default graphing functions of modern data visualisation toolkit. Just like writing, by knowing how to use MS Word, you will not be able to become a great editor."

    "text": "DataViz design process: Start with a clear message\n\n\nIn data visualisation design, it is important to be clear and explicit about what you want to achieve. Is it to explore some data, to convey an inferential analysis, to deliver a message, convince an audience, or support a decision? It may be a mixture of these—for example, even seemingly simple exploratory plots should serve some (perhaps implicit) decision (e.g., on how to explore further). Every graph, and, more generally, every communication, must be tailored to its specific purpose."

When we see data point drawn in a specific location, we tend to interpret it as a precise representation of the true value. It is difficult to conceive that a data point could actually lie somewhere it hasn’t been drawn. Yet this scenario is ubiquitous in data visualisation. Nearly every dataset we work with has some uncertainty, and whether and how we choose to represent this uncertainty can make a major difference in how accurately our audience perceives the meaning of the data.\nTwo commonly used approaches to indicate uncertainty are error bars and confidence bands. In this section, we will examine the basic concepts and design pricinples of these methods."

    "section": "Variation and Its Discontents",
    "text": "Variation and Its Discontents\nRandom and unfair comparisons\n\n\nReference: Variation and its discontents\n\n\nCentral to quantitative data analysis is an understanding of variation. When we measure multiple occurrences of things to determine how and to what extent they differ, we’re examining variation. Some variation is random and some is caused by factors that we can attempt to identify and perhaps control. Random variation consists of differences in measures that occur routinely, without a specific cause. We should note random variation and move on, because nothing can be done about it. It is noise. It tells us nothing that requires a response.\nInstances of non-random variation are signals; they tell us something useful and provide opportunities for action. Signals that indicate poor performance—an undesirable state—can perhaps be reduced by controlling the causes. Signals that indicate an especially good state of affairs can provide useful insights and opportunities for improvement.\nDespite the significance of variation, relatively few people who work with data in most organizations understand it, especially the nature of randomness. This leads to false conclusions and poor decisions, especially when comparing measures of performance within a set of like entities (e.g., countries or companies). Most organizations spend too much time examining noise: the cacophony of random variation. Learning to distinguish signals from the noise is a fundamental skill of data analysis and performance monitoring. In this article, we’ll take a look at a special version of a scatter plot, called a funnel plot (not to be confused with a funnel chart), which is designed to filter out the noise and shine a spotlight on meaningful variation when we compare performance among entities in a group. Funnel plots address the fact that entities with relatively few occurrences of the thing being measured (a small sample), when compared to entities with many occurrences (a large sample), exhibit a greater degree of random variation, which must be taken into account when comparing them. A little later we’ll take a look at this problem and the solution that funnel plots provide in relation to healthcare data, but first let’s get more familiar with the effects of sample size on randomness.\nConsider the following display (a caterpillar plot) of actual healthcare data. Each data point represents a hospital, with 260 in total. The values are mortality rates following surgeries and the solid horizontal line represents the mean.\nThe sample sizes (number of surgeries reported by each hospital) on which this graph is based range from 7 to 3,151. For this reason it isn’t appropriate to rank the hospitals by mortality rate. The ranking suggests a relationship of relative performance that cannot be determined by the data.\nImagine that, unlike the anonymous version of the graph above, each data point is labeled with the hospital’s name. Can you hear the screams of surgeons from the hospitals with the highest mortality rates in the 4th quartile section of the chart? Can you see the puffed up egos of the surgeons who work at the hospitals with mortality rates of zero in the 1st quartile section? One of the hospitals with a zero mortality rate provided a sample of only seven surgeries.\nNote: You might realize, especially if you work with healthcare data similar to the example above, that a fair comparison of hospitals would require the data to be adjusted not just to account for varying sample sizes but also for varying levels of risk. Some surgeries are more risky than others and some patients, due to varying levels of illness, are more at risk than others. We’ll ignore this for now to keep the example simple."

For example, the proportional maps above use circle with different sizes to represent millions of people. There are two types of point features that are typically depicted with proportional symbols: features for which the data represents a geographic position directly (e.g., gallons of oil from individual oil wells), and features that are geographic areas to which data are aggregated and the data magnitudes are assigned to a representative point within the area (e.g., the geographic centroid of a state as in the examples above). In either case, the area of the symbol is scaled to represent the data magnitude, sometimes with a bit of exaggeration to adjust for a general tendency of human vision to underestimate differences in area. A variant on this direct data-to-symbol scaling groups values into categories first, then scales the symbol to represent the mean for the category, assigning a symbol to each place to represent the category range that the mean for the place falls within"

It is designed for both frequentist and [https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/freq-uncertainty-vis.html] visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization: for frequentist models, one visualizes confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”)); for Bayesian models, one visualizes probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist)."

Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on exercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are guided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides will be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson, students are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for reviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection. Students will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise, 7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if absent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 1.5-2 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students with first hand experiences on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page."

Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily."

This is the easiest case, because you’ll get a traceback which allows you to figure out exactly where the error occurred.\nYou don’t get any errors, but some value is incorrect. Here, you’ll need to use the interactive debugger, along with your investigative skills to track down the root cause.\nAll the values are correct, but they’re not updated when you expect. This is the most challenging problem because it’s unique to Shiny, so you can’t take advantage of your existing R debugging skills."

Hence, the application focuses and emphasises on interactivity and effective integration of techniques from data analytics and data visualization.\nA project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution."

Each sub-module should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\nEach project team are required to maintain a comprehensive Minutes of Meeting from the beginning of the project until the end of the project. Each minutes of meeting should include but not limit to the discussion, disagreements, and consensus made and action items agreed within the team. The Minutes of Meeting should also record the division of labour and the considerations involved in the decision made.\nThe following links provided useful guides on how to prepare the minutes of a meeting:\n\nHow to Write Meeting Minutes: Examples + Best Practices\nHow To Write Effective Meeting Minutes(with Templates and Samples)\n\nThe Minutes of Meeting must be uploaded on eLearn within 24hrs after the meeting ended."

It must be used to maintain a complete project version control including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\n\n\nProject Website\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using Quarto. It will be disseminated by using webserver such as Netfity.\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the project website that includes:\n\nThe title of your project,\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\nThe project proposal. This should in a webpage (remember to provide a link at the wiki).\n\n\n\nProject proposal\nEach project teams must start thinking about their project ideas after the Shiny Workshop. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor from week 1 onward. A project proposal in the form of website edited using Quarto will be prepared and the link must be provided on eLearn by 28th May 2023.\nThe project proposal should describe the motivation of the project, problems or issues that the project will address, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem, and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this proposal as a chance to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.\nStudents are required to update their project websites with all the details including the final application, user guide and poster by 2nd July 2023.\n\n\nPoster\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\n\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\n\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\n\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\nResolution = 300dpi or above\nFile format = jpeg or pdf\n\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\nNote: The poster will be considered a final deliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design and data visualisation principles and best practice to your poster.\n\n\nFinal Deliverables\nThe final deliverable will include:\n\nDeployment of the Web-enabled Visual Analytics Application on shinyapps.io by RStudio.\nartifact including the ShinyApp codes, data and all r modules.\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\n\nSample UserGuide 1\nSample UserGuide 2\n\nProject poster\nMinutes of Meeting\n\nThe final deliverable must be uploaded into the Dropbox of e-Learn (e.g. LMS).

    "text": "Setting the Scene\nCity of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\n\n\nThe Task\nIn this take-home exercise, you are required to apply the concepts and methods you had learned in Lesson 1-4 to reveal the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement, using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods. This exercise requires a user-friendly and interactive solution that helps city managers and planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns. The data should be processed by using appropriate tidyverse family of packages and the statistical graphics must be prepared using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\nThe Data\nFor the purpose of this study, two data sets are provided. They are:\nParticipants.csv\nContains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study.\n\nparticipantId (integer): unique ID assigned to each participant.\nhouseholdSize (integer): the number of people in the participant’s household\nhaveKids (boolean): whether there are children living in the participant’s household.\nage (integer): participant’s age in years at the start of the study.\neducationLevel (string factor): the participant’s education level, one of: {“Low”, “HighSchoolOrCollege”, “Bachelors”, “Graduate”}\ninterestGroup (char): a char representing the participant’s stated primary interest group, one of {“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, “H”, “I”, “J”}. Note: specific topics of interest have been redacted to avoid bias.\njoviality (float): a value ranging from [0,1] indicating the participant’s overall happiness level at the start of the study.\n\nFinancialJournal.csv\nContains information about financial transactions.\n\nparticipantId (integer): unique ID corresponding to the participant affected\ntimestamp (datetime): the time when the check-in was logged\ncategory (string factor): a string describing the expense category, one of {“Education”, “Food”, “Recreation”, “RentAdjustment”, “Shelter”, “Wage”}\namount (double): the amount of the transaction\n\nFor explanation of Rent Adjustment, please refer to this link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRefer to Take-home Exercise 1 folder on eLearn to download the data sets.\n\n\n\n\nSubmission Instructions\nThis is an individual assignment. You are required to work on the take-home exercises and prepare submission individually.\nThe specific submission instructions are as follows:\n\nThe analytical visualisation must be prepared by using R and appropriate R packages.\nThe write-up of the take-home exercise must be in Quarto html document format. You are required to publish the write-up on Netlify.\nProvide the links to the Take-home Exercise write-up and github repository onto eLearn (i.e. Take-home Exercise section)\n\n\n\nSubmission date\nYour completed take-home exercise is due on 14th May 2023, by 11:59pm evening.\n\n\nLearning from senior\n\nAY2022-23 January Term\n\n\n\nPeer Learning"
